# Failure-prediction-in-downhole-equipment

In recent years, with the invention and up-gradation of various technologies, there has been a 
massive shift in the practices adopted in the industry. Currently, we are in the advent stage of 
the fourth industrial revolution, Industry 4.0 (I4.0). It explores the latest trends, such as the 
Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, and Machine Learning (ML). This integration of digital 
technologies and ML in the maintenance operation to predict the current state and the remaining 
useful life of the equipment is commonly referred to as Predictive Maintenance (PdM).

Effective well integrity practices like PdM must be implemented to detect leakages enhancing 
the safety of people and the environment. Downhole equipment is crucial and is used while 
drilling, completions, and well workover activities, and they are responsible for maintaining 
production continuous flow from a reservoir. This project deals with predicting failure in 
downhole equipment by detecting leakage in its early stage based on the sensor readings from 
both the downhole and surface equipment. This can help to reduce operating costs and increase 
safety by reducing the severity of accidents that can occur.

To achieve this, the data has been explored to understand the features, preprocessed, and used 
to train the algorithms â€“ Logistic Regression and Random Forest, to achieve a model with the 
best test scores

The data available was unclear as neither the feature names nor the location of the sensors are given. So the focus was mostly on feature reduction.
